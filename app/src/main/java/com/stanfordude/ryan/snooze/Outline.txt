        Trying to "copy" apple's timer apps

The main activity UI will have a button bar at the bottom to switch between fragments
The action bar or a button will be used to create new values
  The alarm fragment, will have a scrollable list of alarm times, which will show the time property,
  and if the alarm is set.

    The alarm times are displayed using a ListView





  Questions:

  How do you programatically use a UI outline, and display it multiple times with different inner values? i.e: like object instantiation
