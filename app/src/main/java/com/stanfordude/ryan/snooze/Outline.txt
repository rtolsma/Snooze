        Trying to "copy" apple's timer apps

The main activity UI will have a button bar at the bottom to switch between fragments
The action bar or a button will be used to create new values
  The alarm fragment, will have a scrollable list of alarm times, which will show the time property,
  and if the alarm is set.

    The alarm times are displayed using a ListView

Will contain a fragment for personal alarms, and a fragment for wakeup notifications to others.
       This fragment will be able to text a group of people a custom message at the scheduled time,
       and will be able to call them at the scheduled time with a custom recording.



TODO:In the alarm fragment, must schedule Alarms using alarmManager when saving and creating AlarmSettings,
also, the previous alarms must be cancelled when editing a setting, and alarms must be deleted
when AlarmSettings are deleted.


Problems: Get the alarms to cancel and be set with the toggleButton checked state:
Using the array Adapter to provide this functionality
